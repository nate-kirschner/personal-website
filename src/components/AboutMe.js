                    Hi, I'm Nate Kirschner.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Currently, I'm a computer science undergraduate student at Northeastern University with a minor in business administration on track to graduate in May 2024. Within the computer science major, my concentration is software, and I'm interested in working as a software or web developer.
                    <br/><br/>
                    For my first Co-op, I'm gaining experience as a software developer at PowerAdvocate where I'm on the workflow team helping to improve their software.
                    <br/>
                    My prior experience includes working as a teaching assistant for the Object Oriented Design class at Northeastern. In addition, Iâ€™ve also developed a number of personal projects you can find in the projects section.     
                    <br/><br/>
